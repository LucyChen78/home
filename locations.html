	  <p>The Mural Room is a sealed area that can only be accessed when the traveller has read the contents of 9 ancient carvings around Dragonspine. Inside the room, there are 2 murals depicting the ancient civilization.
One of the carvings is in the Secret Room. The room can only be opened with the Princess' Box, the Priest's Box and the Scribe's Box. The boxes have descriptions that tell the story of three people of the civilization: the Princess of Sal Vindagnyr, her father King-Priest Varuch, and the scribe Ukko.</p>
