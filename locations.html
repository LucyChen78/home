	<h2> Mural Room</h2>
	  <img src="mural1.png" width="600" alt="Mural of people greeting a god with the Skyfrost Thorn in the middle">
	  <img src="mural2.png" width="600" alt="Mural of a castle on a mountain">
	  <p>The Mural Room is a sealed area that can only be accessed when the traveller has read the contents of 9 ancient carvings around Dragonspine. Inside the room, 2 murals are depicting the ancient civilization and a greatsword that was owned by Imunlaukr, the traveller who lived in Sal Vindagnyr before its fall.</p>
	  <p>One of the carvings is in the Secret Room. The room can only be opened with the Princess' Box, the Priest's Box and the Scribe's Box. The boxes have descriptions that tell the story of three people of the civilization during the fall of the civilization: the Princess of Sal Vindagnyr, her father King-Priest Varuch, and the scribe Ukko.</p>
	  <p>The 2 murals in the room are shown above. One depicts the Skyfrost Nail being cast, and the other depicts the nation and its castles built on the mountain. </p>
	<h2>Durin</h2>
	  <img src="durinsheart.png" width="600" alt="Closer image of Durin's heart"> 
	  <p>Durin's body was casted upon Dragonspine in what is now Wymrest Valley. The dragon's ribcage is visible from above Wymrest Valley, protruding from the many sides of the mountain. Inside a cave in the centre of Wymrest Valley lies Durin's heart.</p>
	  <p>The area around the heart is stained red, and the heart emits a strange source of warmth...</p>
	<h2>The Skyfrost Nail</h2>
	  <img src="skyfrostnail1.png" width="600" alt="Skyfrost nail before restoration">
	  <img src="thorn1.png" width="600" alt="Skyfrost nail in the sky">
	  <img src="thornatsunset.png" width="600" alt="The Skyfrost Nail at sunset">
	  <p>Celestia, the palace in the sky where gods reside, casted the Skyfrost Nail upon the ancient civilization as punishment for questioning the heavens' authority.</p>
	  <p>How the nation opposed Celestia was a mystery, but in any case, Sal Vindagnyr was soon turned into a region of extreme cold.</p>
	  <p>Over time, the Nail broke into three and the pieces caused strange ice to form all around Dragonspine. In the present, the Traveller restores the Skyfrost Nail by breaking all the strange ice. The Nail rose from the peak of the mountain and now floats high above Dragonspine.</p>
